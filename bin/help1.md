####**Welcome to PopNet**

This is currently a demo of the browser-based implementation of PopNet. 

Each node represent one sample, with a chromosome painting embedded within.

Each circle of nodes is one group, representing one subpopulation or lineage.

Drag the nodes to reposition them, or drag the dots to reposition entire groups.

Drag the background to move the view, and use the sroll wheel to zoom in/out.
